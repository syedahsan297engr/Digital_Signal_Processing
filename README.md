# Digital_Signal_Processing
 Starting from the basics of Signal Processing till Filter Designing
 
 * In Lab 1 we will cover basic operations on discrete signals, shifting scaling reversal etc.
 * Lab 2: Focus on Convolution
 * Lab 3: Transfer functions, Z transform, impulse response, frequency response etc.
 * Lab 4: Discrete time Fourier Analysis.
 * Lab 5: Discrete Fourier Transform
 * Lab 6: Filter Structure Designing e.g. Cascaded, Parallel, Direct Form-I , Form-II.
 * Lab 7: IIR Filter Design, ButterWorth and Chebyshev
