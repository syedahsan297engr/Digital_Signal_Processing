# Digital_Signal_Processing
 Starting from the basics of Signal Processing till Filter Designing
 
 * In Lab 1 we will cover basic operations on discrete signals, shifting scaling reversal etc.
 * Lab 2: Focus on Convolution
 * Lab 3: Transfer functions, Z transform, impulse response, frequency response etc.
 * Lab 4: Discrete time Fourier Analysis.
